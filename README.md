## ‚ú® Why Log Reader Mcp?

- ü§ñ **AI-powered log access**: Give your AI assistant (Cursor, etc.) direct, on-demand access to your app logs.
- üß† **Smarter debugging**: Let the AI analyze, summarize, and explain logs as you code.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Save hours**: No more switching terminals, tailing files, or hunting for errors‚Äîget instant feedback and context.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe & isolated**: Never pollutes your project, robust CLI and test coverage.
- ‚ö° **Plug & Play**: One command, zero config, works everywhere.

---

## üë§ Who is it for?

- Backend & frontend developers
- DevOps & SREs
- Teams using AI-powered editors (Cursor, etc.)
- Anyone who wants faster, smarter log analysis!

---

## üì¶ Installation

### üöÄ Automatic (recommended)

```sh
npx log-reader-mcp init
```

- Installs everything, creates `.cursor/mcp.json` and workflow rules, and sets up your logs folder automatically.

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual

1. **Install the package**
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev log-reader-mcp
   ```
2. **Create the config file**
   - At the root of your project, create a folder named `.cursor` (if it doesn't exist).
   - Inside `.cursor/`, create a file named `mcp.json` with:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "log-reader-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "log-reader-mcp"]
       }
     },
     "mcp.enabled": true,
     "mcp.autoStart": true,
     "mcp.showStatusBar": true,
     "mcp.logLevel": "info"
   }
   ```

   - This tells your editor (Cursor, VSCode, etc.) how to launch and connect to the log reader mcp server for your project.

---

## üñºÔ∏è What does it do?

**Log Reader Mcp** exposes your application's logs to your AI assistant/editor (like Cursor) via the Model Control Protocol (MCP). This means:

- The AI can read, filter, and analyze your logs on demand (not streaming)
- You can ask the AI to fetch logs for a specific period, number of lines, error level, etc.
- Makes onboarding, debugging, and incident response dramatically faster

---

## üí° Example Prompts for Cursor

Here are some real-world prompts you can use in Cursor (or any MCP-enabled AI) to interact with your logs:

| Use Case           | Example Prompt to Cursor AI                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| üî¢ Last N logs     | `Show me the last 100 log entries`                          |
| üïí Logs by time    | `Get all logs between 2024-06-01 and 2024-06-02`            |
| ‚è© Logs since date | `Show all logs since 2024-06-01`                            |
| üö® Errors only     | `Show only ERROR or CRITICAL logs from the last 50 entries` |
| üîç Search message  | `Find all logs containing "database connection failed"`     |
| üßë‚Äçüíª User-specific   | `Show all logs for user_id 12345 in the last 24 hours`      |
| üìä Summary         | `Summarize the main issues found in today's logs`           |
| üßπ Clear context   | `Clear the log context and start a new analysis`            |

> **Tip:** You can combine filters, time ranges, and keywords in your prompts. The AI will use Log Reader Mcp to fetch and analyze the relevant log data for you!

## ‚öôÔ∏è MCP Configuration Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "log-reader-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "log-reader-mcp"]
    }
  },
  "mcp.enabled": true,
  "mcp.autoStart": true,
  "mcp.showStatusBar": true,
  "mcp.logLevel": "info"
}
```

- üìÅ Place this in `.cursor/mcp.json`
- Your editor will auto-detect and use the log server

## üìù Log Format (JSON per line)

Each line in `logs/logs.log` should be a JSON object:

```json
{
  "level": "INFO|WARN|ERROR|DEBUG|CRITICAL",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-01T12:34:56.789Z",
  "message": "User login succeeded",
  "service_name": "auth",
  "user_id": "12345",
  "context": { "ip": "192.168.1.10" },
  "event": { "action": "login" }
}
```

## üìù Cursor Rule (Workflow)

To help Cursor (or any MCP-compatible AI) understand your log structure and best practices, you can add a workflow rule file:

### How to add the Cursor rule

1. **Copy the template**
   - Use the command: `npx log-reader-mcp init` (recommended)
   - Or manually copy `templates/mcp-log-server/workflow.mdc` to `.cursor/log-reader-mcp/workflow.mdc` at the root of your project.

2. **What does this rule do?**
   - It describes the log file location, format, and usage standards for your project.
   - It helps the AI agent (Cursor, etc.) understand how to read, filter, and analyze your logs.
   - It documents best practices for logging, security, and debugging for your team.

### Example (excerpt)

```yaml

globs: **/*
alwaysApply: true

# MCP Logging Workflow

- Log folder: `logs/`
- Log file: `logs.log` (one JSON object per line)
- Example log entry:

  {
    "level": "INFO",
    "timestamp": "2024-06-01T12:34:56.789Z",
    "message": "User login succeeded",
    ...
  }

- Use the `read_log` tool to fetch logs by line count or time range
- Never include sensitive data in logs
- Always validate log format before writing
```

### Why add this rule?

- üß† **For the AI**: It enables Cursor to provide smarter, context-aware log analysis and suggestions.
- üë©‚Äçüíª **For developers**: It ensures everyone follows the same standards and makes onboarding easier.
- üîí **For security**: It reminds everyone not to log sensitive data and to validate log structure.

> **Tip:** Keeping this rule up to date helps both humans and AI work better with your logs!

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Is it compatible with VSCode or only Cursor?**  
A: Any editor supporting MCP can use it, including Cursor and future tools.

**Q: Can I use multiple MCP servers?**  
A: Yes, just add more entries in `.cursor/mcp.json`.

**Q: What log formats are supported?**  
A: Only structured JSON logs (one object per line) are supported for full AI analysis.

**Q: Is it safe for production?**  
A: Yes! The tool never modifies your logs, only reads them, and is fully tested.
